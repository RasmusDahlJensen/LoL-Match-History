# Description

This is a personal project that uses the Riot API to retrieve information about the popular MOBA game, League of Legends. The main feature of the application is to display various statistics of a player's in-game performance such as their win rate, KDA ratio, and most played champions.
The front-end was built with React. Dotenv was used to securely store the Riot API key.

## Main usecases

   * Search for a summoner's profile by their in-game username
   * Display the summoner's rank, win rate, KDA ratio, and most played champions
   * Display the win rate, KDA ratio, and game count of each champion
   * Display the summoner's match history, including champion played, KDA ratio, and game outcome

## Learning Opportunities

This project offered opportunities to learn about several key concepts and technologies including:

   * Using an external API to retrieve data
   * Managing API keys and environment variables
   * Building a responsive front-end with React and React Router
   * Parsing JSON data and rendering it dynamically in the front-end
   * Handling errors and edge cases when making API requests
   * Implementing search functionality to query an API

   1. Clone the repository
   2. Run npm install to install dependencies
   3. Create a .env file in the root directory and set your Riot API key as VITE_API_KEY
   4. Run npm start dev to start the development server

## Usage
